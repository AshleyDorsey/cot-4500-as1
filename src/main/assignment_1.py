# Question 1: Use double precision, calculate the resulting values (format to 5 decimal places)
#       a) 010000000111111010111001



# Question 2: Repeat question 1 using three-digit chopping arithmetic



# Question 3: Repeat question 1 using three-digit rounding arithmetic



# Question 4: Compute the absolute and relative error with the exact value form question 1 and its 3 digit rounding



# Question 5: What is the minimum number of terms needed to computer f(1) with error <10^-4?



# Question 6: Determine the number of iterations necessary to solve f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 10 = 0 with accuracy 10^-4 
# using a = 4 and b = 7.
#       b) Using the bisection method
#       c) Using the newton Raphson method
